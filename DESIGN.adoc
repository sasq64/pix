(or Primer: a Prop√¶deutic Enchiridion)

== MAIN PROJECT GOAL

Getting _people_ to experience the _joy of programming_.

(which means it will also be a good teaching tool).


=== The Programming Environment

* Is _immersive_ and _free of distractions_.
* Allows for _experimentation_ and _investigation_.
* Provides _extremely_ fast turn-around between editing and running.
* Is good at instantly detecting as many code errors as possible,
  and indicating them in the editor.
* Should have fun / real world use (ie multiplayer games?)


=== Teacher Bot

The teacher bot is an AI teacher that can help the programmer.

Prompting is important here to get the AI do act correctly;

The AI should not generate code, and only provide example code in small bits
when necessary.

It should be clear that the AI is fallable.

We should colllect meta data from user activity to allow good prompts. AND
possible integration with third-party "teacher" AI systems


=== Now vs The 80s

The project is built on the experience of learning to program on home computers
in the 80s and early 90s. The situation now is different in significant ways;

The programming environment _was_ the front facing part of the computer.

Learning to program in that environment had a clear path to writing real world
software and games.

Now its not clear that programming via text is at all the way most new creators
will approach software development

So:

Young people will unlikely approach an environment like this on their own, it
must happen through parents or teachers.

But:

I think a none-trivial number of persons who starts playing with this kind of
environment _will_ enjoy it and learn through it.

=== Additional Hooks

* Gamification through AI led challenges
* Writing games that your friend can test in real time
