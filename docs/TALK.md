INTRO

My github page says addicted to programming since 85, and its only a half joke

Grew up with 8-bit/16-bit machines

Self learned, knew many like minded

Experimentation, demoscene

Absolute _joy_ of programming

Current approaches

BASIC. Old beards. Kids wont like this

Python step by step, print, guess number. Fun? No

MY TAKE

Python - because its the Basic of our time

GPU based 2D == Can make actual fun games, but can be grokked
Lower = No fun, Higher = Hard (Use Unity)
